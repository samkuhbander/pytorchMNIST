# pytorchMNIST
Using pytorch on MNIST dataset for practice
This code is a PyTorch implementation of a neural network for the MNIST dataset. 
The MNIST dataset consists of images of handwritten digits and is widely used for image classification tasks. 
The code loads and preprocesses the MNIST data and then defines a convolutional neural network (CNN) class with two convolutional layers and a fully-connected layer. 
The code then trains the CNN on the MNIST training data and evaluates its performance on the test data.
